there once was a large pink vampire named reginald who loved to suck the retinas out of eyeballs and watch professional FIFA tournaments. one day on his way back from the supermarket near the coast of Thailand he was intercepted by a 400 personnel regiment armed with stakes, semi-automatics and holy hand grenades that was dispatched by the UN via battlecruisers.
It's xiangjun ma, and I just inserted a paragraph. I'm telling another story
Reginald wanted to suck people's blood. However, when he went to the beach, the strong sun hurt his skin. And people were not hurt.
(I believe each addition is supposed to be the continuation of the story that is already in the file)
Reginald saw the fleet of battlecruisers and took his turn, he called out "B4" and sunk their destroyer. When the mercenary group threw their grenades at Reginald, he used his knowledge of soccer to kick the grenades right back at them, he was truly the Messi of his generation
Then, however, Messi heard of this analogy and immediately teleported behind Reginald's back and said "You are no match for me, fool. You have no right to take my name and my place" and promptly beheaded Reginald. The UN tried to thank Messi for his contributions, but Messi suddenly evolved into an even larger pink vampire and flew away into the indian ocean, never to be seen again.
